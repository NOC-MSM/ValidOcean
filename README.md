# ValidOcean
**Leveraging the cloud to accelerate ocean model validation.**

This Python package is designed to facilitate the reproducible validation of the large-scale circulation & hydrography simulated in ocean general circulation models with available observations and ocean (re)analyses.

In development: an adaptable workflow to compare ocean model sea surface temperatures to available observations.
